# Java-Calculator
A Java Calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes user input, processes the calculation, and displays the result. The project can be implemented with a console or GUI interface to practice Java fundamentals.

Key Components:

1) User Interface (UI):

A graphical user interface (GUI) can be created using Swing or JavaFX to display buttons for numbers and operations.
Alternatively, a console-based program can take input from the user via the command line.


2) Operations:

Basic arithmetic operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Optionally, advanced operations like modulus (%) or square roots can be added.

3) Backend Logic:

The program takes input from the user, processes the numbers and the selected operation, and then outputs the result.
For each operation, methods/functions are defined to handle the specific logic, such as add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide().

Features:

Input Validation: Ensures valid numbers and operations are entered.
Error Handling: Handles cases like division by zero or invalid input.
Modular Design: The program can be expanded with more functions, like square roots, exponents, etc.

This simple calculator project is a great way to learn about user input, control structures (like switch-case), and basic arithmetic operations in Java.
